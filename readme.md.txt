Yes, the world needs yet another 6502 Simulator.

This project is based on the MOS6502 Simulator
by Gianluca Ghettini.  I liked how it was put together
so I picked this one to modify and add more stuff.  This
may be slow going as I am also writing an LL(1) parser
generator, a 6502 assembler and linker, and an ACTION!
6502 compiler with features that make it more suitable
for embedded programming (all this stuff is realated).
